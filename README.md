# GraphQL Server Demo

This is a sample app for understanding a bit more of how GraphQL resolvers function. We are using [@graphql-codegen/cli](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen) for generating types and resolver stubs using the [typescript](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen/plugins/typescript/typescript) and [resolvers](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen/plugins/typescript/typescript-resolvers) plugins.

There are log statements in each reasolver so you can see how resolvers get run based on your operation.
